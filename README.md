# 🛒 Les Course – Grocery List App

**Les Course** is a Flutter app to manage grocery lists with smart item suggestions, categories, priority sorting, and dark/light themes. It automatically saves your items and customizations.

This application was developed almost entirely using the **Claude Sonnet 3.7 LLM**, an advanced AI model that independently generated over 3,000 lines of functional code. This project focused on prompt engineering to evaluate and demonstrate how effectively an LLM can assist in full-stack application development.
